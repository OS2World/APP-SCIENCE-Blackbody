Subject: Re: Blackbody update

Dear Mr. Frommert,

A week or so ago, I sent an update to my Blackbody curve program
which is posted on the SEDS web site. Thanks for posting that. It
appears  you may not have received the update, so (I hope I'm not being
redundant and wasting your time) here is a new version which has the
graphing portion rewritten so it can plot blackbody curves upwards
from one microdegree. The source code is attached (feel free to
distribute it, if it will encourage more OS/2 programming).

Thanks for making an icon for the program. I really appreciate your
interest and support of science and OS/2!

Sincerely,
Robert Miller (millerr@mdot.state.mi.us)
